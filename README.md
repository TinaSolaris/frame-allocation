# frame-allocation
A console app that simulates the work of different frame allocation algorithms (Equal, Page Fault Frequency,
Proportional, Random and Working Set) based on different page replacement algorithms (ARLU, FIFO, LRU, Optimal 
and Random)	and compares their performance time on the same test data.
